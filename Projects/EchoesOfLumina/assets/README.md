# Assets folder

The assets folder should contain all the non-code parts of your project. For now there are folders for image files and sound files. If you needed to use font files, for example, you would create another folder called `fonts` and put them in there.
to whomever will read this, i had so much fun doing this project that i just wish i had more time on it.

my game is a story based game where you wake up in the forest and try to leave but something lurks around....
